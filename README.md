## Surface:

The colour scheme for my website is a contrast between grey , white & black , after trying a few different themes i decided this option looked the most appealing with the section headers/titles in a black text box with white writing . Each section of the page should have a single line border above/below to  show users clearly its a seperate section.
The fonts picked are from Google fonts, with symbols used throughout page abtained from font-awesome.

The layout used for the site should be consistent throughout keeping same style/design & colour.

## Features:

This is a fully responsive website with the following pages :
1. Home
2. Gallery	
3. Trainers
4. Sign Up

The font on each page in consistent and the same , i used the same fonts which were between 
- Font Roboto
- Font Anton
- Font exo

## Nav Bar:
The nav bar is full width accross the page which when it collapses into smaller viewing screeen eg tablet & phone device it collapses into a tab button which once clicked opens the nav.
The Nav bar highlights which page your currently on and highlights and underlines when user hovers above the other page links. The nav bar sits above the carousel and is in the same posiition throghout the page.
The nav bar has site logo on top left with social media links on top right , which have been keptin the same colour scheme which also hover too.
