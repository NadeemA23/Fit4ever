On each page the social media links are included in the footer with the current page highlighted so user can easily identify which page they are on.The navigation links also highlight and underline when you hover over for easy use to know which page you will be navigating to next.

By having multiple pages allows for good structure/flow , allows audience to freely move accross pages with organised sections knowing which page contains certaon information.

## Scope:


In order to get the correct info and business ideas across , the website will contain these features
- Header/logo in top left of nav bar
- menu/nav bar to easily navigate accross pages with nav links being highlighted on hover
- Picture carousel/slideshow on homepage with next/prev arrows
- Gallery of images on seperate page

- Map with opening times section
- Footer including Quick links to easily navigate to all pages
- Video on trainers page to make page more appealing and to catch users attention
- Sign up form for user to get a call back to complete sign up 
- Same colour scheme / design throughout page.

## Surface:

The colour scheme for my website is a contrast between grey , white & black , after trying a few different themes i decided this option looked the most appealing with the section headers/titles in a black text box with white writing . Each section of the page should have a single line border above/below to  show users clearly its a seperate section.
The fonts picked are from Google fonts, with symbols used throughout page abtained from font-awesome.

The layout used for the site should be consistent throughout keeping same style/design & colour.

## Skeleton: 

Please note the actual design has changed slightly since these wireframes.
i initially was using Balsamiq to create the wireframes however the application crashed and will not load again causing me to loose the first produced wireframes.I have attempted to install Balsamiq a few times to the same result. 

ive since used an alternative site however with more time i could have produced more detailed wire frames like the first ones.

## Features:

## Lighthouse:

Lighthouse is a very good & useful tool found in chrome developor and is used to show the websites 
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Best Practices
- SEO

![Lighthouse screenshot](assets/images/lighthouse.png)

As shown above initially my site was not too bad overall , which i then improved on to get the best i can.

I made an effort to improve this by reducing image sizes , adding preconnect to certain links , addin meta , improving layout which all led to my scores improving even more!
![Lighthouse screenshot](assets/images/readmescore.png)

## HTML and CSS Validation:

I often validated my HTML and CSS code whilst building the website to avoid making the same small errors and to decrease work load at end of project.
Upon running my HTML code now i encountered 1 error shown below, this was easily fixed by changing the incorrect icon type to image/x-icon.
![validator screenshot](assets/images/validator.png)

Upon submition site has 0 errors.
![validator screenshot](assets/images/validator1.png)
![validator screenshot](assets/images/validator2.png)
## Known bugs and fixes:

As part of my testing I wanted to make sure that all of my clickable social links worked & opened up in a new page, I found that the links opened in the same window. I used the target _blank to open a new window and used the 'rel="noreferrer"' to all external links as this is considered best practice.

I removed the social icons from the top navbar from my tutor advise and also in case it deterred users from the site , instead i moved them into the footer.

I converted most images to .webp to improve load times .

Initially my carousel was too big and after getting feedback from my tutor Guido i put more time into the carousel to get it to the perfect size.This was easily resolved by resizing the images and the carousel. i also converted and compressed the images for faster load times.

As part of my testing i encountered an error on trainers.html which was not appearing for the other pages,after investigating i realised i had used a h1 heading more than once which was bugging the site.This was easily resolved by changing the h1 to h2.

Throughout the entire process, I used Google Dev Tools to debug the website and its layout, this allowed me to check the responsiveness of the site and quickly debug any issues that I came across.
