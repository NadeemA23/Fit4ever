          <h2 class="pt1">Why Choose Personal Trainers?</h2>
          <p>A personal trainer (PT) is a certified individual who has the knowledge, skills and abilities to design
            safe and effective exercise programmes.

            They help their clients to achieve health and fitness goals, such as fat loss, muscle gain, improved sports
            performance and various other aims, by delivering a safe and effective workout programme, and providing
            guidance, support, and motivation.

            Many Personal Trainers choose a career within the fitness industry as they have undertaken their own journey
            and are passionate about helping others achieve their health and fitness goals. You might look at a PT and
            think they have always been physically fit, but often they know what it’s like to be new to a gym
            environment and not knowing where to start.</p>

          <h2 class="pt3">Your sessions</h2>
          <p>Being open with your PT will help you to get the most out of your personal training sessions. Being honest
            about your goals, your fitness, and what effort you are willing to put in, will help your PT to design a
            programme that fits with your lifestyle.

            Use your Personal Training as a tool to learn by asking questions that will help you even when you go alone.

        <p>Weighed myself this morning and I’ve lost 1 stone in 31 days. Could not of done it without the help from
          Tough Cookie Fitness. I can’t stick to a diet and
          I always join the gym and go twice then cancel my membership. Jonathan has helped me completely change my diet
          and make me be more confident in myself when it comes to exercise.
          I was so nervous about starting personal training with him as I’ve never done anything like it before but the
          professionalism, encouragement and support I’ve received is amazing!
          Not only am I loosing weight and gaining confidence, I am happier and stronger. Looking forward to losing the
          next 2 stone and having a fab beach bod for Ibiza.

        <p>Jack takes a real consultative approach and doesn't adopt a 'one size fits all' attitude in his approach to
          your training. His knowledge is super impressive,
          not only in relation to the body but nutrition also and as one of his students this gives you the belief that
          you are actually working towards a goal that is absolutely achievable.
          We are about to adapt my plan to accommodate a new fitness goal and I have absolute faith that
          Jack will get me where I need to be. Seeing results is awesome - Jack definitely knows how to push and get the
          best out of you. Thank you Jack!</p>

      <p>A personal trainer is a great way to invest in yourself. Aaron is great at keeping exercise fresh. He is super
        knowledgeable about fitness and nutrition, as well as being a great encourager. I would definitely recommend him
        if you are wanting to start feeling better from the inside out. You’ll also find yourself being able to do
        things you didn’t think you could, that’s my favourite bit ….. it’s like you have your own personal cheerleader
        while you are working out – who doesn’t want that?!?

      <p>Andy is the best trainer I’ve had. He keeps your goals in mind, and helps you smash them. Training with Andy
        has given me more confidence and motivation to try new things at the gym as well as drop a couple of dress sizes
        and become so much stronger.
        I cannot recommend Pt with Andy enough, my favourite things were -he checks in with you every week, tailors work
        outs to help meet your goals and most importantly he’s friendly, professional and motivates you to meet your
        goals.
        Thank you Andy for all your help. Keep doing what you do!</p>

      <p>I selected Jordan from JAAB Fitness as my trainer as he like myself was a rugby player, I wanted to impove on
        my strength but for it to be sport specific to rugby to aid me in my games of a weekend. I started training with
        Jordan in Feburary last year, it's now been a year and the improvement in my game has been massive. Jordan
        showed me an array of excercises I would have never have even thought off that helped me gain both strength and
        size, this has been invaluble to my game and I cannot thank him enough. A massive thanks to
        findmypersonaltrainer.com for putting us in touch.</p>

      <p>I've been working with Matt as my PT for a month and he is fantastic. His knowledge and advice is second to
        none as he has provided me with a perfect platform for improving my fitness and nutrition. Matt is a great
        motivator who is able to give a great insight into performing exercises and techniques as well as detailing the
        science behind it, which I have found interesting and informative. He works on both the physical and mental
        aspects of fitness and he always gives his all, which has pushed me to give more than I thought I was capable
        of. Top bloke, great PT. I would recommend Matt to anyone.</p>
