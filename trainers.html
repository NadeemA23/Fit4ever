                      <h3>Why Choose Personal Trainers?</h3>
                      <p>A personal trainer (PT) is a certified individual who has the knowledge, skills and abilities to design safe and effective exercise programmes. 

                        They help their clients to achieve health and fitness goals, such as fat loss, muscle gain, improved sports performance and various other aims, by delivering a safe and effective workout programme, and providing guidance, support, and motivation.
                        
                        Many Personal Trainers choose a career within the fitness industry as they have undertaken their own journey and are passionate about helping others achieve their health and fitness goals. You might look at a PT and think they have always been physically fit, but often they know what it’s like to be new to a gym environment and not knowing where to start.</p>

                      <h3>Making The Most Out of your sessions</h3>
                      <p>Being open with your PT will help you to get the most out of your personal training sessions. Being honest about your goals, your fitness, and what effort you are willing to put in, will help your PT to design a programme that fits with your lifestyle. 

                        Use your Personal Training as a tool to learn by asking questions that will help you even when you go alone. </p>
